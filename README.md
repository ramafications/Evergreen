CS M148 data science project


(a) Main document: Your main document can be a readme explaining
  i. the data set your team used
  
  ii. the overview of the problem your team addressed
  
  iii. the key methodology that worked to address the problem with explanations as to why
  
  iv. results including cross-validation used and evaluation metrics and conclusions such as why
  you chose the key method and its limitations
  
  v. how to use the code for your project on the data set.


(b) Appendix: In the appendix you will discuss the methods that you applied to reach your final
project goal from the check-ins. You should use this as a check-list to make sure you discuss all of
these aspects of your work either in your main report or appendix. If a method is the key method
in the main document, you can just mention that it is discussed in the main document.

  i. Explain the exploratory data analysis that you conducted. What was done to visualize your
  data and split your data for training and testing?
  
  ii. What data pre-processing and feature engineering (or data augmentation) did you complete
  on your project?
  
  iii. How was regression analysis applied in your project? What did you learn about your data
  set from this analysis and were you able to use this analysis for feature importance? Was
  regularization needed?
  
  iv. How was logistic regression analysis applied in your project? What did you learn about your
  data set from this analysis and were you able to use this analysis for feature importance?
  Was regularization needed?
  
  v. How were KNN, decision trees, or random forest used for classification on your data? What
  method worked best for your data and why was it good for the problem you were addressing?
  
  vi. How were PCA and clustering applied on your data? What method worked best for your
  data and why was it good for the problem you were addressing?
  
  vii. Explain how your project attempted to use a neural network on the data and the results of
  that attempt.
  
  viii. Give examples of hyperparameter tuning that you applied in preparing your project and how
  you chose the best parameters for models.
